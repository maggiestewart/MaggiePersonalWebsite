#### After dabbling in HTML/CSS/JS in the Spring 2022 semester with my [LSU Revamped Schedule Booklet](https://github.com/maggiestewart/LSUScheduleBookletProject) project, I wanted to get more hands-on experience by designing, maintaining, and producing my own website. 
#### Please feel free to take a look at my website, which highlights my interests, current/past projects, and achivements.
